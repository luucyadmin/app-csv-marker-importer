This is an example luucy plugin.

You'll need [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system.
We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as your code editor, but any normal editor should work too.

After installing node js, open a terminal and type the following commands ot install the luucy command line interface and typescript:
```
$ npm install -g luucy-cli typescript
```

Open the downloaded directory in your editor and use the following commands to start developing locally!

```
$ luucy serve
```
